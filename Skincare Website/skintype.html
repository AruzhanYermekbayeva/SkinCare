                <h1>5 Common Skin Types</h1>
                <ol class="skin-type-list">
                    <li>Oily Skin: Oily skin tends to produce excess sebum, leading to a shiny appearance, especially in the T-zone (forehead, nose, and chin). It is prone to enlarged pores and is more susceptible to blemishes and breakouts due to the buildup of oil and debris.</li>
                    <li>Dry Skin: Dry skin lacks moisture and often feels tight or rough. It may appear dull and flaky, especially in colder months or in dry climates. Dry skin can be sensitive to harsh skincare products and may be more susceptible to signs of premature ageing like fine lines and wrinkles, which usually appear due to dry skin lacking the delicate balance of oils and moisture, slowing down cell turnover, and making it more vulnerable to damage from pollutants and UV rays.</li>
                    <li>Combination Skin: Combination skin is characterised by having areas that are both oily (usually the T-zone) and dry or normal (cheeks).</li>
                    <li>Sensitive Skin: Sensitive skin is easily irritated by external factors such as weather, skincare products, or environmental pollutants. Among other causes, sensitivity can be the result of an underlying skin condition, a weakened skin barrier, or environmental factors such as weather or pollutants. It may react with redness, itching, or burning sensations.</li>
                    <li>Normal Skin: Normal skin is well-balanced with neither excessive oiliness nor dryness. It typically has a smooth texture, small pores, and a healthy-looking complexion. Normal skin is less prone to sensitivity or breakouts, making it the least problematic of all skin types.</li>

                        <h2>1. Visual Inspection</h2>
                        <p>Visual inspection involves closely examining your skin's appearance and texture in different areas of your face in natural light.</p>
                        <h3>Oily Skin:</h3>
                        <p>Look for a shiny appearance, especially in the T-zone (forehead, nose, and chin). Enlarged pores may also be noticeable.</p>
                        <h3>Dry Skin:</h3>
                        <p>Check for flakiness, tightness, or rough patches, particularly after cleansing. It may appear dull and lackluster.</p>
                        <h3>Combination Skin:</h3>
                        <p>Note oily areas in the T-zone with visible pores, contrasted with drier patches on the cheeks, which may feel tight.</p>
                        <h3>Sensitive Skin:</h3>
                        <p>Look for signs of redness, itching, or inflammation, especially in reaction to certain products or environmental factors.</p>
                        <h3>Normal Skin:</h3>
                        <p>Look for a consistent texture and color without excess shine, dryness, or visible signs of sensitivity.</p>

                    <div class="method2-text">
                        <h2>2. Blotting Paper Test</h2>
                        <p>Using blotting paper on your face can help to determine oiliness. For this test, press blotting paper against different areas of your face in the morning before cleansing.</p>
                        <h3>Oily Skin:</h3>
                        <p>Blotting paper will quickly absorb excess oil, revealing a greasy residue.</p>
                        <h3>Dry Skin:</h3>
                        <p>Blotting paper may not pick up much oil, indicating a low sebum level.</p>
                        <h3>Combination Skin:</h3>
                        <p>Blotting paper will absorb oil from the T-zone but less from the cheeks.</p>
                        <h3>Normal Skin:</h3>
                        <p>Note if the blotting paper picks up minimal oil, indicating a balanced sebum production without excess or deficiencies.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="method-container3">

                            <h2>3. Touch Test</h2>
                            <p>The touch test involves feeling different areas of your face to assess texture and moisture levels. After washing your hands thoroughly, use your fingertips to assess how your skin feels to the touch.</p>
                            <h3>Oily Skin:</h3>
                            <p>Skin feels slick and greasy to the touch, particularly in the T-zone.</p>
                            <h3>Dry Skin:</h3>
                            <p>Skin feels tight, rough, or flaky, indicating a lack of moisture.</p>
                            <h3>Combination Skin:</h3>
                            <p>T-zone feels oily while cheeks may feel normal or dry to the touch.</p>
                            <h3>Sensitive Skin:</h3>
                            <p>Notice if the skin reacts negatively to touch, showing signs of redness or irritation. Note that not all sensitive skin will necessarily react to this test, depending on its degree of sensitivity.</p>
                            <h3>Normal Skin:</h3>
                            <p>When you touch normal skin, it feels neither excessively oily nor dry. It has a consistent texture and feels smooth to the touch. Normal skin typically does not show signs of redness, irritation, or noticeable bumps.</p>
